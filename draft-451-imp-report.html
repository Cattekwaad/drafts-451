<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document evaluates the usage of HTTP Status Code 451, which was standardized by the IETF in February 2016 <a href="#RFC7725" class="xref">[RFC7725]</a>. This implementation report aims to illuminate whether the status code does what it set out to do (&#8220;provide transparency in circumstances where issues of law or public policy affect server operations&#8221;), the different ways it is being used, positive and negative impacts the standard might have and we end with suggestions for improvement of the standard.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="#RFC7725" class="xref">[RFC7725]</a> specifies a status code for web resources that are blocked for legal reasons. The HTTP status code 451 is designed to enable content providers and intermediaries (including ISPs and search engines) to notify users that their access to specific web resources has been blocked for legal reasons. The standard also recommends that the notification include an explanation. This is important because this is the detail the user needs to be able to understand why access has been blocked, and if desired, to take action to challenge the blocked access. It also helps content servers and intermediaries who have been required to block access to notify users who directed that access by blocked.</li>
<li>Also, as the 451 status code is machine-readable, researchers and others could use web crawlers to identity which blocked URLs or sub-resources use error code 451. This data could be used to produce a searchable open repository of all known error code 451 instances. This information could then be used to map the blocked Web and to analyze the explanations, looking for trends and anomalies. For example, one day there might be an answer to the question &#8211; &#8220;how much content is blocked for IPR reasons?&#8221;</li>
<li>The 451 status code can also be used for encrypted webpages, which is significant as encryption on the Web becomes more and more prevalent. A user should be able to see the error code irrespective of whether they try to access the content via HTTP or HTTPS.</li>
<li>This standard is a prime example of an Internet protocol enabling common policy objectives (in this case, transparency) to be implemented across the world. However, as with all IETF standards, the implementation of the 451 status code is voluntary.  So, how widely it is used will likely depend on a number of factors, including a legal/political regime that does not penalize transparency, the willingness to be transparent and the capability to implement.</li>
<li>It is possible that status code 451 code could be used for other purposes (e.g. to mislead users as to the reason for the content being blocked), especially as &#8220;legal reasons&#8221; is not defined.</li>
<li>It is also possible that content providers and intermediaries who are required to block content for legal reasons to be asked or compelled to use another status code (e.g. 404). In these circumstances, content providers and intermediaries should include information in their transparency reports to indicate whether this is happening, by, for example, stating: &#8220;We have/have not been required to replace 451 by other status codes.&#8221;</li>
<li>There may be a temptation in some cases of the implementation of status code 451 to include the ability to identify and/or track the users that visit a web resource that has been blocked. This raises significant privacy issues.</li>
<li>The usage of HTTP status code 451 might lead to an increase in blocking because it makes analyzing compliance easier.</li>

<ul>
<li>The reporting format needs to cover information enough to satisfy transparency and offer insight about possible misuse of 451 error as a vehicle for censorship.</li>
<li>Transparency requirement will be better served through standardization of fields and descriptions. Currently many implementations for HTTP status code 451 do not provide the reason for blocking. This could be attributed to the fact that the different needs are not sufficiently documented in RFC7725. This could be fixed by adding fields in the header. Useful categorization fields to accurately describe content blocked by legal reasons are:</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">&#8211; Identification of the legal source on which the blocking request is based.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">&#8211; Identification of the complainant/requestor if is an institution (not if individual because of privacy concerns).

A Supreme Court decision from 2016 held that it was possible to request a news oulet to remove content in its website to enforce the constitutional right of privacy, when the data is no longer relevant and it availability on the network cause harm to the data subject. The case was controversial because the information was about a public servant condemned in a pedophilia case.

The Supreme Council of Cyberspace (SCC), established in 2012, develops policies related to cyberspace governance. However, blocking and filtering directives originate from various levels of the government, including through direct orders by the judiciary independent of the SCC and CCDOC. Other organizations involved in the censorship process include the Iranian Cyber Police (FATA) and the Telecommunication Company of Iran. By national law, the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI) is the exclusive provider of Internet bandwidth in the country. All ISPs have to purchase bandwidth from TCI and are legally bound to use censoring software. Such a system enables a centralized filtering program for all Internet traffic in the country.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.15.2.p.1">In Iran, freedom of expression is regulated by the Penal Code and the Press Law of 1986. The Press Law was amended in 2000 to mandate that publishing online without a license was grounds for blocking, effectively censoring services such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. Iran also has Internet-specific laws, such as the 2001 resolution called &#8220;Regulations and Conditions Related to Computerized Information Networks&#8221; that ordered that ISPs remove &#8216;offensive&#8217; websites and mandated the use of filtering technology. The main law in terms of applicability to Internet censorship is the Computer Crimes Law (CCL) of 2009. CCL prescribes articles that provide for content-based restrictions on the Internet usage of Iranian citizens. Articles 21 through 23, in particular, hold ISPs liable for filtering content and reporting illegal material (as described in the articles) to a &#8216;web crimes committee&#8217; made up of government officials. ISPs are also required to store usage data and logs about visited web pages for a window of at least six months.  It is worth noting that none of the terms used in the CCL are defined strictly, potentially over-broadening its scope. There have been many cases of Iranian bloggers being prosecuted for violation of censorship laws.  National Internet Project: The Iranian government has been working towards the creation of a National Internet Network which would domestically host all accessible Internet content, isolating Iranian citizens from the World Wide Web. Implementation of the national network would make it easier for the government to block services and web pages through measures such as intelligent filtering. Already the use of social networking platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Viber is heavily monitored and controlled.</p>

The request is then approved by the state or central Chief Secretary. This step is not required if the Nodal Officer has initiated the blocking procedure without any complainant. The request is then forward to the head of CERT-IN. If it is not a public emergency, the persons or intermediaries should be given 48 hours to respond. But this is not required if the emergency provision has been invoked, but the block list still has to be reviewed by &#8220;Committee for Examination of Request&#8221; within 48 hours after the block been issued. The block lists are usually issued directly to ISPs and are marked confidential and are implemented unevenly with some ISPs providing sparse details if users try to access the blocked resources and other ISPs returning a 404 Error Code.</p>

Under this provision, after a website operator receives a 512 notice, it must: 1) remove the material &#8220;expeditiously&#8221;; 2) notify the poster that someone has alleged copyright infringement in that material and that the material has been removed; and 3) send any &#8220;counternotices&#8221; from the poster &#8211; objections from the poster to claims of copyright &#8211; to the original complaintant. The complaintant must notify the website operator that it has filed a lawsuite within 10-14 days or the website can reinstate the removed material.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.17.2.p.1">There are a number of other legal methods that are used with much less frequency in the United States:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Defamation: Under US law, balancing the freedom of speech in the US constitution is also a right to be free from untrue attacks on one&#8217;s reputation.  Threats and lawsuits are regularly filed claiming statements are untrue and reputationally damaging.</li>
<li>Rights of publicity: The United States has a number of States that recognize a &#8220;right of publicity&#8221;, typically a right enjoyed by celebrities and public figures to limit the ability of others to use their likeness, name, or recognizable features for commercial purposes.</li>
<li>Non-consensual sexually-explicit imagery: A number of content providers and online content hosts (intermediaries) have begun to honor request to take down material that may include sexually-explicit imagery that was either captured without consent or shared online without consent (cite).</li>
<li>Mugshot images: Images taken in the process of a law enforcement arrest or detention have increasingly been subject to state-based regulation in the United States, recognizing that people may suffer undue reputational harm from the display and searchability of this kind of content <a href="#ElManzalawy" class="xref">[ElManzalawy]</a>.</li>
<li>Trademark-based takedowns: A US law, The Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), protects the owners of trademarks from abuse by entities &#8220;cybersquatting&#8221; on domain names that contain their trademarks (cybersquatting is proactively registering a domain name to demand substantial fees from the trademark holder). Trademark holders can use the remedies in this law to request cancellation or transfer of the domain name as well as damages.</li>
<li>E-Commerce Patents: Because software can be patented in the United States, there are regular claims made by patent holders against online content and services that they claim infringe their patent.</li>
